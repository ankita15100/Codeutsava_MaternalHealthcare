<h1>Choosing Safe Baby Products: Carriers</h1>



<p><b>Babies love and need close contact, and infant carriers are ideal for nestling
 them against their parents. Most injuries that occur with these carriers result from 
falls.Baby carrier is a 
a supporting device worn by an adult for holding an infant close to the torso
and a portable seat with a handle for carrying an infant Two types of carriers are available: one is pouch-like, and the other has a frame.</b></p>
<h2>What to look for:</h2>
<div class="background">
  <div class="transbox"><p><b>
•	The carrier should have straps that prevent your baby from falling or crawling out. Look for 
firm, padded head support. Try to match your baby's size and weight and make sure there is enough depth
 to support the back and that the leg openings are small enough to prevent your baby from slipping out.<br>
•	Check for ease of use. Some of the soft ones are difficult to put on because of numerous straps.<br>
•	A framed carrier should have a kickstand that locks in the open position. The folding mechanism 
should be free of pinch points that could catch your baby's fingers. Look for padding on the metal frame 
around the infant's face.<br>
•	Try the pack on for comfort, both with the baby in it and without.<br>
•	Ideally, the fabric should be durable with strong stitching or large heavy fasteners to prevent slippage.<br>
•	Pockets or zippered compartments are handy for storing frequently needed items.</b></p></div></div>
<h2>SAFETY NOTES:</h2>
<div class="background">
  <div class="transbox"><p><b>
•	Always keep one hand on your baby while he or she is in water.<br>
•	Only adults or experienced babysitters should give babies baths. Baths can be dangerous for babies, because babies
 can drown in as little as an inch of water.<br>
•	Always touch the water to check the temperature before putting your baby in the bathtub. Water that is too hot can burn babies.<br>
•	Gather all of your baby's bathing supplies ahead of time, including shampoo, soap, washcloth, towel, clean clothes, and a clean diaper/wipes.<br>
•	Always take your baby with you if you have to answer the door or the telephone or if you're needed elsewhere in the house.<br>
•	Always empty the bathtub and turn it upside down when it is not being used.</b></p>

<h1>Choosing Safe Baby Products: Bathtubs</h1>



<p><b>Baby bathtubs give parents a controlled environment for cleaning a wet, slippery baby. The angle of the tub helps free a parent's hands for washing.</b><p><br><br>
<h2>Things to keep in mind when choosing an infant bathtub:</h2>
<div class="background">
  <div class="transbox"><p><b>
•	The bathtub should have slip-resistant backing to keep it from moving.<br>
•	A tub made of thick plastic will stay firm in the center, even under the weight of the water.<br>
•	Beware of foam cushions; your baby could tear off pieces and swallow them.<br>
•	Avoid bath rings, baby flotation devices, and bath seats. If these tip over, the baby could drown.<br>
•	Do not choose a tub with rough edges, which can scratch your baby.<br>
•	An infant-to-toddler tub will last longer as it can be adjusted when your baby grows.<br>
•	Some bathtubs have plastic slots or indentations that can hold soap, shampoo, and other cleaning supplies.<br>
•	A plug at the bottom of the tub makes draining the water easy.<br>

<h1>Choosing Safe Baby Products: Changing Tables</h1>
<img  src="3.jpg" alt="can't display" align="right" style="width:304px;height:228px;">


<p><b>Generally, you can choose from three kinds of changing tables:<br>
•	wooden ones with guardrails<br>
•	fold-up models<br>
•	hinged chest adapters<br>
Hinged chest adapters are not recommended — dressers with these adapters have toppled over when a baby's weight was placed close to the outer edge.
Babies can get hurt if they fall off changing tables, so they should always be watched closely.
</b></p>
<h2>What to look for:</h2>
<p><b><div class="background">
  <div class="transbox"><p><b>
•	Wooden changing tables with rails are usually the least likely to sway or tip over when a baby pulls on them from the floor.<br>
•	Fold-up models should be checked for sturdiness: When the table is open, give it a good shake.<br>
•	A wire changing table should have a wide base so that a baby can't pull it over on top of himself or herself from the floor.<br>
•	The table should have shelves or compartments for storing everything you'll need. This prevents you from 
        taking your eyes off your baby while you look for that hard-to-find item. You should keep supplies within your 
        reach, but out of the baby's reach, since many diaper supplies are dangerous for babies.<br>
•	A flat changing surface should be surrounded on all four sides by a guardrail, which should be at least
 2 inches (5 centimeters) in height. The surface should be lower in the middle than on the sides, which helps keep the baby from rolling from side to side.<br>
</p></b></div></div>
<h2>SAFETY NOTES:</h2>
<p><b><div class="background">
  <div class="transbox"><p><b>
•	Use the safety belt every time you change your baby.<br>
•	Never leave your infant unattended even if you think he or she is secure.<br>
•	Stop using your changing table when your baby reaches the age or weight limit recommended by the manufacturer, which is typically age 2, or 30 pounds 
(13,607 grams).<br>

<h1>Choosing Safe Baby Products: Cribs</h1>

<p><b>Of all nursery products, cribs are responsible for the most infant deaths. Whether you choose a new crib or a hand-me-down, evaluate it carefully to ensure that your baby's
 resting place is safe.
</b></p>
<h2>What to look for:</h2>
<p><b><div class="background">
  <div class="transbox"><p><b>
•	Side rails should be fixed and not adjustable. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) banned the sale of adjustable
        side rails for safety reasons. Do not purchase or accept a used crib with an adjustable side rail.<br>
•	The distance between slats must be no more than 2-3/8 inches (6 centimeters) to protect infants from falling out 
        and toddlers from trapping their heads between the slats.<br>
•	If the crib has corner posts, they must be either flush with the top of the headboard and footboard or very tall — over
        16 inches (41 centimeters). Anything in between is a potential strangulation hazard.<br>
•	Get the firmest mattress you can find. Don't rely on manufacturers' labels — test it yourself. This is extremely 
        important because soft mattresses may play a role in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).<br>
•	Be sure that the mattress fits snugly in the crib. This keeps a baby from slipping in between the mattress and the crib sides.
        Buy a mattress pad that fits tightly and make sure that the plastic mattress packaging has been removed.<br>
•	Evaluate a used crib with extra care. There may be too much space between slats, or elaborate cut-outs in the headboard and 
        footboard that can trap a baby's head. A crib made before 1978 may have a finish that contains lead, so a crib that has been in the family for 
        generations may not be the best one to use!<br></div></div>

</p></b>
<h2>SAFETY NOTES:</h2>
<p><b><div class="background">
  <div class="transbox"><p><b>
•	Always place your baby on his or her back to sleep.<br>
•	Check all screws and hardware regularly and tighten them if necessary.<br>
•	To prevent suffocation, never place soft bedding or soft toys (blankets, fluffy comforters, pillows, plush toys) in your baby's crib.<br>
•	Although bumper pads have been widely used, their safety has been questioned. One study, using data from the CPSC, found a number of 
        accidental deaths appeared to be related to the use of bumper pads in cribs and bassinets. Pediatric organizations strongly discourage the use 
        of bumper pads in cribs to avoid accidental suffocation.<br>
•	Once your baby starts to pull up, remove crib gyms and mobiles to prevent entanglement. If you have bumper pads in the crib, remove them 
        when your baby starts to stand so they cannot be used to help climb out of the crib.<br>
•	Never place a crib near a window or drapes, because your baby can become entangled in window blind and drape cords. Remove bibs and 
necklaces when your baby is in the crib. Do not hang toys by strings.<br>

<h1>Choosing Safe Baby Products: Toys</h1>


<p><b>All toys you select for your baby should meet safety standards. The tips below can help you find safe toys for your little one.
 Once the toys are at home, check them often for loose or broken parts.<br><br><br>
</b><p>
<h2>What to look for:</h2>
<p><b><div class="background">
  <div class="transbox"><p><b>
•	Always follow all manufacturers' age recommendations. Some toys have small parts that can cause choking, so heed all warnings on a toy's packaging.<br>
•	Toys should be large enough — at least 1¼" (3 centimeters) in diameter and 2¼" (6 centimeters) in length — so that they can't be
        swallowed or lodged in the windpipe. A small-parts tester, or choke tube, can determine if a toy is too small. These tubes are designed to 
        be about the same diameter as a child's windpipe. If an object fits inside the tube, then it's too small for a young child. If you can't find one of these products, 
        a toilet paper roll can be used for the same purpose.<br>
•	Avoid marbles, coins, balls, and games with balls that are 1.75 inches (4.4 centimeters) in diameter or less because they can become
        lodged in the throat above the windpipe and restrict breathing.<br>
•	Battery-operated toys should have battery cases that secure with screws so that kids cannot pry them open. Batteries and battery fluid
        pose serious risks, including choking, internal bleeding, and chemical burns.<br>
•	When checking a toy for safety, make sure it's unbreakable and strong enough to withstand chewing. Also, make sure it doesn't have:
	sharp ends or small parts like eyes, wheels, or buttons that can be pulled loose<br>
•	small ends that can extend into the back of a baby's mouth<br>
•	strings longer than 7 inches (18 centimeters)<br>
•	parts that could become pinch points for small fingers<br>
•	Most riding toys can be used once a child is able to sit up well while unsupported — but check the manufacturer's recommendations.
        Riding toys like rocking horses and wagons should come with safety harnesses or straps and be stable and secure enough to prevent tipping.
•       Hand-me-down and homemade toys should be carefully evaluated. They may not have undergone testing for safety. Do not give your infant 
painted toys made before 1978, as they might have paint that contains lead.<br>
•	Stuffed animals and other toys that are sold or given away at carnivals and fairs are not required to meet safety standards. Check
 carnival toys carefully for loose parts and sharp edges before giving them to your infant.<br>
Check to see if a toy has been recalled by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) by browsing their recall page, here. You also can 
join a mailing list to receive news about the most up-to-date toy recalls.<br>

<p></b></div></div>
<h2>SAFETY NOTES:</h2>
<p><b><div class="background">
  <div class="transbox"><p><b>
•	Never give balloons or latex gloves to kids younger than 8 years old. A child who is blowing up or chewing on a balloon or gloves can choke by 
inhaling them. Inflated balloons pose a risk because they can pop without warning and be inhaled.<br>
•	Never give your baby vending machine toys, which often contain small parts.<br>
•	Keep older siblings' toys out of the reach of infants<br>
